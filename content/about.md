I am from Wooster, Ohio--a small city nestled among rolling hills of beautiful agricultural land. Home to both the College of Wooster--with a very international student body--and Ohio State's Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Wooster enjoys an unusually robust food culture, with thriving year-round farmers' markets and food cooperatives and a plethora of locally-owned restaurants, butchers, and breweries and distilleries. 

This gastronomic background, combined with my whole family's love of a good meal (and my mother's constant baking projects!) planted the seeds of what has been a lifelong interest in cooking, baking, and eating; I am never happier than when I am undergoing a slightly overambitious cooking project, preferably one that requires either eggs or excessive salt and a fun knife.

In high school, I lived in Mexico for a year due to my parents' jobs. Ask me about that if you are interested, but the upshot was that I did the International Baccalaureate program to make the transition easier, and part of that requires an independent research project. I took the opportunity to explore genetics--a topic that had long interested me in an abstract way--and did a small PCR project under the tutelage of Drs. Loveless and Fraga, both in the biology department at the College of Wooster. I enjoyed the project so much that I joined [Dr. Francis's tomato lab](https://www.tomatolab.net/) that summer as an intern. I loved the work we did, but wanted to explore my options, so over the course of the next several years during my bachelors at Oberlin College I was a serial intern, working in labs studying everything from marsupial embryonic development, mouse brain gene expression, freshwater flocculent sediment, and mustard root and shoot developmental hormones.

After college I took a few years off from higher education, and during this time I evaluated my many internships and job shadows to decide on a career. I decided my most engaging and fulfilling research experience had still been my time in tomato breeding, so when I decided to pursue my doctorate I applied primarily to breeding programs. I found that the labs I was most interested in weren't necessarily breeders, but rather the army of geneticists, statisticians, programmers, and other support scientists who make their efforts possible. Thus, I ended up at NCSU in a wheat genotyping lab, where I have happily been playing with too much data while shaping myself into a geneticist with a strong computational skill-set since.
