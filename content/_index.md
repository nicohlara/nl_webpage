I am a PhD candidate in the Eastern Regional Small Grains Genotyping lab under Dr. Gina Brown-Guedira.

I am interested in probing the frontier of predictive genomics to make plant breeding faster and cheaper, and thus better face pressing issues of food security and access.

I also a serial hobbyist and tinkerer. Read my blog!
