I cook. A lot. And while most of my cooking starts with a vague idea (black beans and rice, say, or shepherd's pie) and proceeds haphazardly based on what we have, what is about to go off, and any techniques I've been practicing or want to try out, I have amassed  quite a collection of recipes over the years--things I like to reference, things with specific and inflexible proportions (e.g. baked goods), special family recipes that shouldn't be messed with too much, etc.

Currently these reside in a longform google document with inconsistent format. This allows me to access my recipes from anywhere with internet and share my document freely with friends and family, but is annoying to scroll through and to format. With the success of creating an auto-populated resume and cv on this website, creating a recipe book with tags, sorting, and a standard format seems a logical next step. In this post I will outline briefly the process I used to create this cookbook, then showcase a few recipes with personal annectodes, in lieu of prefacing every recipe with pages of text in standard recipe blog fashion.
