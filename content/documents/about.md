I am a PhD candidate in the Eastern Regional Small Grains Genotyping lab under Dr. Gina Brown-Guedira

I am interested in probing the frontier of predictive genomics to speed and cheapen plant breeding to better face pressing issues of food security and access.

I also am a serial hobbyist and tinkerer.
