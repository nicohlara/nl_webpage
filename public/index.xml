      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am from Wooster, Ohio, a small city nestled among rolling hills of beautiful agricultural land. Home to both the College of Wooster&amp;mdash;with a very international student body&amp;mdash;and Ohio State&amp;rsquo;s Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Wooster enjoys an unusually robust food culture, with thriving year-round farmers&amp;rsquo; markets and food cooperatives and a plethora of locally-owned restaurants, butchers, and breweries and distilleries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gastronomic background, combined with my family&amp;rsquo;s love of traveling and food, our several years living abroad in Mexico, Chile, and England, and my mother&amp;rsquo;s constant baking projects planted the seeds of a lifelong interest in cooking, baking, and eating; I am never happier than when I am undertaking a slightly overambitious cooking project, preferably one that requires either eggs or excessive salt and a fun knife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-why&#34;&gt;The why&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago I took a professional development course as part of my training fellowship (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ggscholars.org/&#34;&gt;Genetics and Genomics Scholars&lt;/a&gt;) and was recommended to set up a personal website. Intrigued, I looked into the matter, and promptly shelved it as less important at my current stage as a first-year Ph.D. student than getting data and learning how to do analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I took another professional development class as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triticeaecap.ucdavis.edu/&#34;&gt;Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Project&lt;/a&gt; and, again, they recommended that we set up personal websites. Now that I am an Nth year Ph.D. candidate and am beginning to look for jobs I finally took the advice and began looking into the different ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
