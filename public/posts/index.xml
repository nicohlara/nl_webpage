      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-why&#34;&gt;The why&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago I took a professional development course as part of my training fellowship (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ggscholars.org/&#34;&gt;Genetics and Genomics Scholars&lt;/a&gt;) and was recommended to set up a personal website. Intrigued, I looked into the matter, and promptly shelved it as less important at my current stage as a first-year Ph.D. student than getting data and learning how to do analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I took another professional development class as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triticeaecap.ucdavis.edu/&#34;&gt;Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Project&lt;/a&gt; and, again, they recommended that we set up personal websites. Now that I am an Nth year Ph.D. candidate and am beginning to look for jobs I finally took the advice and began looking into the different ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
