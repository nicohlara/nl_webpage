    <h2 id="the-why">The why</h2>
<p>A number of years ago I took a professional development course as part of my training fellowship (<a href="https://ggscholars.org/">Genetics and Genomics Scholars</a>) and was recommended to set up a personal website. Intrigued, I looked into the matter, and promptly shelved it as less important at my current stage as a first-year Ph.D. student than getting data and learning how to do analyses.</p>
<p>Last year, I took another professional development class as part of the <a href="https://triticeaecap.ucdavis.edu/">Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Project</a> and, again, they recommended that we set up personal websites. Now I am an Nth year Ph.D. candidate and am beginning to look for jobs, so I finally took the advice.</p>
<p>I am a tinkerer (and perhaps a bit of a luddite) at heart, and love a good project, so after looking into the usual commercial recommendations (wix, squarespace, etc.) I decided that the perfect thing to do while writing my thesis was to create my own webpage using HTML and self-host it on the 2008 Dell desktop I bought out of a storage unit for $70 to fix a car that is now set up as an occasionally-used home server.</p>
<p>Did I mention that my partner and I just had a baby?</p>
<p>After a 2 AM feeding my practical side put his foot down and told me that I couldn&rsquo;t build a website from scratch while writing a dissertation and raising a newborn, so I looked around for a compromise solution&ndash;5 minutes on a selfhosting forum on <a href="https://lemmy.world/c/selfhosted">lemmy</a> (a free and open-source discussion forum compatible with the ActivityPub protocol) told me that if I was willing to have a static webpage (I am) then <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> would do most of the backend structure and legwork for me to produce a static HTML webpage that I could host on my GitHub page for free, and even point a custom domain to&ndash;perfect!</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The How</h2>
<p>After that preamble, I am documenting the actual how&ndash;mostly as an exercise in writing to help me get into the flow of things for my thesis, but also so that in six months when I forget what I did to make my resume I can refer to something.</p>
<ol>
<li>Installing Hugo and setting up the website</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all I had to install the application. I run Fedora on my personal laptop, so I first grabbed the version from dnf&ndash;which is outdated and can&rsquo;t install the themes to complete the tutorial. No problem, I said&ndash;I recently learned how to build from source, so I decided to try that. Half a frustrating hour later, I had installed Go, installed Hugo, and discovered that I could run Hugo only by calling the complete /path/through/the/system/to/go/bin/hugo. Not ideal! I decided to call it a night, and had a lucky breakthrough while brushing my teeth&ndash;hadn&rsquo;t I heard of something called aliasing in bash that could help?</p>
<p>The next time I worked on the project I tried
<code>alias hugo=&quot;/path/to/go/bin/hugo&quot;</code>
and voila! hugo works as it should.</p>
<p>I followed the rest of <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo&rsquo;s tutorial</a>, then perused the available themes. After quickly becoming overwhelmed, I chose the first that jumped out at me (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/paperesque/">paperesque</a>), then followed that theme&rsquo;s tutorial (side note, though Fedora seems to include git subtree, I couldn&rsquo;t access it. The easiest way to fix the path I found was simply installing it again). I also found downstream that I had to edit the base templates (found at theme/paperesque/layouts/_default/baseof.html when an update invariably breaks this) for the paperesque theme to allow block rendering, which was not included by default. This was simply adding the line <code> {{ block &quot;main&quot; . }}{{ end }}</code> to the body class statement.</p>
<p>I now had a functional but unpopulated website; now to fill it!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Content</li>
</ol>
<p>After reviewing my notes from my professional development sessions and looking at a couple of online guides, I decided on a few things to prioritize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An about page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An online resume for quick reference, to be added as a QR code to a business card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When presenting, a page with my poster/presentation for others to reference afterwards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blog, partly as a creative writing exercise and for practice before writing journal articles or my dissertation, and partly to showcase some of the work I do that would not otherwise make it into my resume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Populating</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the above four items, the about page and a blog are built into the paperesque theme. It seems easy enough to upload an HTML or image of a poster, so I will cross that bridge when I next make it to a conference, so that leaves me with a resume page. I easily set up a markdown document with a list of items and accomplishments, but it wasn&rsquo;t as polished or clean looking as my real resume (crafted in google sheets of all things, because it let me play with margins and formatting best). After googling briefly, I came across an <a href="https://aldra.co/blog/hugo_structured_data/">intriguing post</a> detailing how to make a database populated resume that I decided to implement. After an hour or so of frustrating tinkering and exploring of templates, I found out my theme didn&rsquo;t support layouts&ndash;after adding the line I mentioned above I was off to the races! I have very little experience with HTML or CSS, which is what templates in Hugo use as far as I can tell, so everything I did happened through trial and error, googling, and not an insignificant amount of asking AI to write me HTML code to do &lsquo;X&rsquo;. I quickly grew familiar with the basics, however, resulting in the product you see on my &lsquo;resume&rsquo; page&ndash;it is still a work in progress, but I am excited about the possibilities of using a basic template for each section and having content files for each work experience, rather than updating an unwieldy Word/Apple Pages/Google Sheets/etc. doc, and having to migrate it to a new proprietary platform every few years when the format hack I was using to get my margins right inevitably breaks in an update.</p>
