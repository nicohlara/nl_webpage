      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am from Wooster, Ohio, a small city nestled among rolling hills of beautiful agricultural land. Home to both the College of Wooster&amp;mdash;with a very international student body&amp;mdash;and Ohio State&amp;rsquo;s Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Wooster enjoys an unusually robust food culture, with thriving year-round farmers&amp;rsquo; markets and food cooperatives and a plethora of locally-owned restaurants, butchers, and breweries and distilleries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gastronomic background, combined with my family&amp;rsquo;s love of traveling and food, our several years living abroad in Mexico, Chile, and England, and my mother&amp;rsquo;s constant baking projects planted the seeds of a lifelong interest in cooking, baking, and eating; I am never happier than when I am undertaking a slightly overambitious cooking project, preferably one that requires either eggs or excessive salt and a fun knife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
