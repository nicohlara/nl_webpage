        <p>I am from Wooster, Ohio, a small city nestled among rolling hills of beautiful agricultural land. Home to both the College of Wooster&mdash;with a very international student body&mdash;and Ohio State&rsquo;s Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Wooster enjoys an unusually robust food culture, with thriving year-round farmers&rsquo; markets and food cooperatives and a plethora of locally-owned restaurants, butchers, and breweries and distilleries.</p>
<p>This gastronomic background, combined with my family&rsquo;s love of traveling and food, our several years living abroad in Mexico, Chile, and England, and my mother&rsquo;s constant baking projects planted the seeds of a lifelong interest in cooking, baking, and eating; I am never happier than when I am undertaking a slightly overambitious cooking project, preferably one that requires either eggs or excessive salt and a fun knife.</p>
<p>In high school, I lived in Puebla, Mexico for a year due to my parents&rsquo; jobs. In the interest of brevity I will skip the details, but one highlight was the International Baccalaureate program which requires an independent research project. I took the opportunity to explore genetics&mdash;a topic that had long interested me in an abstract way&mdash;and did a small PCR project under the tutelage of Drs. Loveless and Fraga, both in the biology department at the College of Wooster. I enjoyed the project so much that I joined <a href="https://www.tomatolab.net/">Dr. Francis&rsquo;s tomato lab</a> that summer as an intern. I loved the work we did, but wanted to explore my options, so over the course of the next several years during my bachelors at Oberlin College I was a serial intern, working in labs studying everything from marsupial embryonic development, mouse brain gene expression, freshwater flocculent sediment, and mustard root and shoot developmental hormones.</p>
<p>After college I took two years off from higher education to explore career options. I decided my most engaging and fulfilling research experience had still been my time in tomato breeding, so when I decided to pursue my doctorate I applied primarily to breeding programs. I found that the labs I was most interested in weren&rsquo;t necessarily breeders, but rather the army of geneticists, statisticians, programmers, and other support scientists who make their efforts possible. Thus, I ended up at NCSU in a wheat genotyping lab, where I have happily been playing with too much data while shaping myself into a geneticist with a strong computational skill-set.</p>
